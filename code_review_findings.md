# Magic Carpet Game Code Review Findings

## Dead Code Identified

### player.js
- **Status**: Redundant/Unused
- **Reason**: Contains player boundary logic that is duplicated in gameplayScene.js
- **Impact**: None (functionality exists elsewhere)
- **Recommendation**: Safe to delete

## Unused Files
- LOCALSERVER.py (Python file in JS project - likely development artifact)
- Some files in js/utils/ directory (need further verification)

## Optimization Opportunities
1. **Physics System**:
   - Could benefit from spatial partitioning for collision detection
   - Consider using fixed timestep for more consistent physics

2. **Particle System**:
   - Pooling is implemented but could be optimized further
   - Consider WebGL-based rendering for large particle counts

3. **Audio System**:
   - Audio context resume/suspend logic could be simplified
   - Consider Web Audio API optimizations

## Next Steps
1. Remove player.js
2. Verify if LOCALSERVER.py is needed
3. Review utils directory for unused files
4. Implement optimizations for physics and rendering
